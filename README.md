# testairjump

An easy external airjump cheat for minecraft (Tested on BLC 1.8.9, not sure if works on other version but still ok)

The first to implement a functioning ModuleBaseAddress getter without the TlHelp32.h library, which is uncapable of handling minecraft and other more 
modern processes
